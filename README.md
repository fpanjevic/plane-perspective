Projective geometry visualization tool developed using Paper.js

While reading [Introduction to Projective Geometry by C. R. Wylie](https://www.amazon.com/Introduction-Projective-Geometry-Dover-Mathematics/dp/048646895X), I needed a visualization tool to help me work though the exercises (and learn some JS in the process). I highly recommend the book (tried Faulkner as well, didn't enjoy it as much).
